Hi, I'm a Software Engineer and an Enterpreneur. I'm passionate about sharing knowledge, documentation, web engineering, and others.
I'm interested in web3 development,
blockchain technologies, user experience
and software engineering.
I’m currently learning how to be a fullstack
blockchain software engineer.
I’m looking for internships and collaborations on projects.
